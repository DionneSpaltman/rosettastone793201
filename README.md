# Rosetta Stone 2

### Objective
An alien civilization has discovered an ancient text file on the abandoned Earth, containing
millions of sentence pairs. Their challenge is to decipher how closely related these sentence
pairs are, effectively developing a semantic similarity detection model.

### Dataset Features
- Contains ~1 million lines with paired sentences.
- Some sentence pairs share the same meaning, while others differ.
- Requires feature engineering and text preprocessing.

### How to Get the Dataset
The dataset consists of textual sentence pairs, requiring preprocessing steps such as
tokenization, stemming, and embedding techniques to facilitate model training. It is
available for download on LUISS learn webpage.

### Assignment
1. **Data Processing**  
   - Apply NLP techniques such as word embeddings, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

2. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Enhance the dataset using paraphrasing techniques to improve model robustness.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Design a Neural Network for sentence similarity measurement.  
   - Experiment with different architectures (e.g., transformers, LSTMs).

4. **Evaluation & Reporting**  
   - Test the model on unseen data and analyze performance.  
   - Prepare a comprehensive report on methodology and insights.
